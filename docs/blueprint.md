## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft teal (#74c69d) to evoke feelings of financial well-being and calm.
- Background color: Light greenish-grey (#e9f5f0), a desaturated version of the primary color to give good separation.
- Accent color: Warm orange (#e9c46a) as an accent, because orange is 30 degrees from teal on the color wheel; its brightness and warmth draw the user's attention.
- Font: 'Inter' sans-serif, which has a modern, neutral look, suitable for both headlines and body text
- Use consistent, outline-style icons for categories, accounts, and actions. Avoid overly detailed or distracting icons.
- Emphasize a clean, straightforward layout, using a single-column format on mobile devices. Minimize visual clutter and prioritize key financial data.
